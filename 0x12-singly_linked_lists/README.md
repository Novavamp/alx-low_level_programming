## Singly Linked List in C
This program presents an implementation of a singly linked list data structure in the C programming language. The linked list comprises nodes, each with an integer value and a pointer to the subsequent node in the list.

## Files
The program consists of two files:

singly_linked_list.c: This file encompasses the implementation of the singly linked list data structure. It includes functions for creating a new linked list, adding a node to the end of the list, removing a node from the list, and printing the list's contents.

main.c: This file holds the main function, responsible for creating a new linked list, adding nodes to the list, removing a node from the list, and printing the list's contents.

## Usage
To utilize this program, compile the singly_linked_list.c and main.c files using a C compiler like gcc:

gcc -o singly_linked_list singly_linked_list.c main.c

This compilation process generates an executable file named singly_linked_list. Execute the program as follows:

./singly_linked_list

The program creates a new linked list, adds nodes to the list, removes a node from the list, and prints the list's contents.
